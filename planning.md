Build a Knowledge Assistant that allows users to upload documents (PDFs, text), indexes them, and answers queries based on document content using **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** — all hosted on your own infrastructure.

---

## **Stack (All Open-Source):**

| Component | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| Backend API | **FastAPI** |
| Document Parsing | **PyMuPDF**, **pdfminer**, **BeautifulSoup** |
| Embedding Models | **sentence-transformers (BERT-based models)** |
| Vector Database | **Qdrant** (or **Weaviate**) |
| RAG Orchestration | **LangChain** or **LlamaIndex** |
| LLM (for generation) | **Open Source Models via Ollama** (e.g., **LLaMA 3**, **Mistral 7B**, **Phi-3** using **llama.cpp** backend) |
| Frontend | Minimal HTML/JS or **React** (optional) |
| Deployment | Docker Compose / K8s (Optional) |
| Authentication | Simple JWT with **FastAPI Users** |
| Model Serving | **llama.cpp**, **Ollama**, **vLLM** |

## **Full Roadmap:**

---

### **Phase 1 — Research & Setup (Week 1-2)**

- [ ]  Finalize stack: FastAPI, Qdrant, LangChain, Ollama, Llama.cpp.
- [ ]  Setup local dev environment.
- [ ]  Install & run Qdrant locally via Docker.
- [ ]  Install LangChain & try basic document loading examples.
- [ ]  Setup Ollama with LLaMA or Mistral models.
- [ ]  Explore sentence-transformers for embeddings.

---

### **Phase 2 — Backend API MVP (Week 3-4)**

- [ ]  Implement FastAPI endpoints:
    - [ ]  `/upload` — Upload document.
    - [ ]  `/query` — Query endpoint.
    - [ ]  `/health` — Health check.
- [ ]  Use PyMuPDF for PDF parsing & text extraction.
- [ ]  Chunk documents (LangChain text splitter).
- [ ]  Generate embeddings (sentence-transformers).
- [ ]  Store chunks + metadata in Qdrant.
- [ ]  Implement query logic:
    - [ ]  Accept query → Embed → Retrieve top-k from Qdrant.
    - [ ]  Format context for LLM prompt.
    - [ ]  Call LLM via Ollama/llama.cpp.
    - [ ]  Return answer.

---

### **Phase 3 — Frontend & Integration (Week 5)**

- [ ]  Build minimal frontend (React or plain HTML) for:
    - Uploading documents.
    - Query input/output.
- [ ]  WebSocket (optional) for live querying.
- [ ]  Implement Authentication (JWT via FastAPI Users).

---

### **Phase 4 — Deployment & Scaling (Week 6)**

- [ ]  Dockerize FastAPI + Qdrant.
- [ ]  Deploy Ollama with LLM models.
- [ ]  Optional: Deploy on VPS or self-hosted server.
- [ ]  Setup simple monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana optional).
- [ ]  Write Deployment Guide.

---

### **Phase 5 — Polish & Documentation (Week 7)**

- [ ]  Write API Docs (Swagger/OpenAPI via FastAPI).
- [ ]  Create GitHub README with:
    - Architecture Diagram.
    - Setup Instructions.
    - Sample Queries.
- [ ]  Write a Medium/LinkedIn Post explaining your build.
- [ ]  Record demo video.

## **Architecture Overview:**

```
[Frontend] --> [FastAPI Backend] --> [Qdrant for Retrieval]
                                   --> [Ollama/llama.cpp for LLM]

```

---

## **Sample Features List for MVP:**

- Document upload with parsing & chunking.
- Query API with context retrieval & generation.
- Local embedding + storage using vector DB.
- Open-source LLM serving locally.
- API secured with simple JWT.

---

## **Optional Advanced Features (Post-MVP):**

- Multi-user support with auth.
- Document categories/tags.
- Query history & logging.
- LLM selection on runtime (switch models).
- LangChain Agent support.
- Frontend with context preview.
